Hello , Keyur this side !!

The project that I have made is an demo project . I made this project while learning bootstrap. Basically , i have created an 2 static webpages of an clothing brand named Ovia. 

There were many issues in my code and my structure of writing code , but i'll improve my designing part as soon as possible , as I told it's an static UI inspired by figma.

I have used HTML , CSS , BOOTSTRAP but kinda it's not responsive.
